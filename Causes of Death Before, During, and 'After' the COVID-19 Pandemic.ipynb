    "As COVID-19 continues to cause significant numbers of deaths across the globe, one of the greatest talking points during the last few years has become the effect of the pandemic on our mental health, as well as the fluctuations of death numbers of various causes. The US Department of Health & Human Services keeps data for death counts for several different causes, separated by month, stretching from 2014 to 2023. In this project I will be analyzing the data and answering a few questions that are of special interest to me."
